Test automation can be used to undertake large-scale system testing with repeatable results. An effective approach involves identifying the repetitious tasks that can be automated and designing test cases that cover all of the necessary test scenarios. Selenium and Appium can be used to automate web and mobile applications respectively, and these tools can also be used to simulate real-world user actions such as swiping and scrolling. Continuous integration tests can also be automated using frameworks such as Jenkins, which can be used to deploy and test code on different devices and environments. This ensures that changes to code do not introduce unexpected issues, and can be monitored and reported on easily.
